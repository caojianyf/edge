    FROMLIST: pwm: gpio: Add a generic gpio based PWM driver
    
    This patch adds a bit-banging gpio PWM driver. It makes
    use of hrtimers, to allow nano-second resolution, though
    it obviously strongly depends on the switching speed of
    the gpio pins, hrtimer and system load.
    
    Each pwm node can have 1 or more "pwm-gpio" entries,
    which will be treated as pwm's as part of a pwm chip.
